# Pyrrhus - Universal One-Click Hyperscale installer

Currently only support Mac OS X as it is the only hyperscale operating system.  And your PowerBook Duo is just like the cloud.

Installs, Docker, Kubernetes, Rust, Ruby, NodeJS, Golang something called kubedb, an `sh` installer, and potentially many other things; But how would I know?


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Deployment is precisely the same thing so you should not worry. Not one bit.

### Prerequisites

A command-line.

### Installing

```
curl -sf -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OriPekelman/pyrrhus/master/install.sh | sudo sh
```


## Running the tests

There are no tests, because testing is doubting and you do trust me.

### Coding style

Yolo, advanced edition.

## Deployment

I told you, its just like development. 

```
curl -sf -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OriPekelman/pyrrhus/master/install.sh | sudo sh
```

## Built With

All the things.

## Acknowledgments

* Hat tip to anyone who created a | sh installer and made developers lives easier;
* Thanks to the Joomla community who have created a 22kb .gitignore used for extra cloudiness in this project.
* Warm regards to my colleagues at https://platform.sh that allow me not roll my own infrastructure on every project which makes me feel like an adult. Which I rarely do.
